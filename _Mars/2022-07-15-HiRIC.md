China's first Martian exploration mission, the Tianwen-1 probe carrying the Zhurong rover, was launched in July 2020 and entered the Martian orbit in February 2021, successfully landing Zhurong in southern Utopia Planitia on May 15, 2021. From mid-February to early May 2021, the Tianwen-1 probe performed detailed investigations of the potential landing site in southern Utopia Planitia using its onboard instruments. Among these investigations, images obtained by the High-Resolution Imaging Camera (HiRIC) were used for high-precision and high-resolution 3D topographic mapping to facilitate the selection of the best landing site for the Zhurong rover and provide data support for various scientific studies.
